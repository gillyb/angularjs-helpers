Tooltip Directive  
==  

This is a simple directive to create a cool tooltip.  
As usual, each sample I found on the internet was much more bloated than this.  
  
  
Sample usage :  
```html
<my-tooltip text="This is just a tooltip">
  <span>some trigger for the tooltip</span>
</my-tooltip>
```


Some features I need to add:  
* Ability to control direction of the tooltip (top, bottom, right, left)  
* Add html or maybe basic markdown to the tooltip (not really sure I want this)
